Recursion

What is recursion?
  In computer science:
    A problem solving technique, closely related to mathematical induction

      (induction: a proving technique to make an argument that something
      is true, proving a universal truth --> proof under certain assumptions,
      but based on this we can prove that is is true for other things)

    where we define the solution as a combination of solutions to
    smaller instances of the same problem


Developing a recursive algorithm

  Step 1: the base case
    - solve the problem for the smallest possible input

  Step 2: the recursive step
    - define the recursion hypothesis
      --> Assume that "when calling the function on a smaller input,
          it does its job"
    - based on this assumption, find how to combine calls to smaller
      instances in order to solve the problem for the given input


((FIGURE 1))
  - for execution
    - we see that it works when n = 1, prints 1 (base case)
    - then when we do n = 2, we call when n = 1,
      and we know that so print 2 --> produces 1 2
    - when n = 3, we call n = 2, know produces {1 2},
      then print 3 --> produces 1 2 3
    - when n = 4, we call n = 3, know produces {1 2 3},
      then print 4 --> produces 1 2 3 4

((FIGURE 2)) -- the memory image

  Note: we dont really get into execution that much/how the
        computer actually processes this, we usually stay in
        the logical theoretical level knowing that it works the
        way it should

        --> we dont develop the algorithm based on the way the
            computer executes it and tracing how it works in the memory
            (like we have in the past)

        --> instead, the way we come up with recursive algorithms is by
            the steps above --> logical assumptions and proofs


((FIGURE 3)) --> doing it by printing first half then second half
                (includes line graph, code and execution trace)


((FIGURE 4)) --> example: count_down

((FIGURE 5)) --> example: count_up_and_down
  - assumption: "when calling count_up_and_down on a smaller
                range it would print the numbers of that range
                in an ascending followed by descending order"
